# Picollo Integration Platform Core Module

Picollo is a modular solution designed for systems integration, built on open-source Java-based SpringBoot and Spring frameworks.

It combines the ease of development of production-grade Spring-based applications with the flexibility of a modular OSGi engine. This fusion of SpringBoot and OSGi empowers Picollo to deploy components and configurations at runtime, making it a continuously available service. Hence, Picollo is often referred to as "Picollo the non-stop service", serving both systems integration and microservices creation needs.

The roadmap for Picollo aims to transform it into a highly available and scalable platform for developing nano modules. The term "nano modules" describes the capability to deploy business logic in small, granular modules, seamlessly integrated into the Picollo service in a non-stop manner.
